Extract ALL hardware design rules that can be verified by examining the schematic, netlist, and BOM. Focus on:

INCLUDE these types of rules:
• Power supply voltage ranges and current requirements
• Pin connection requirements (pull-up/pull-down resistors with specific values)
• Component requirements (capacitor values, resistor values, crystal specifications)
• Electrical interface requirements (I2C, SPI, UART connection rules)
• Grounding and power plane requirements  
• ESD protection requirements
• Component placement requirements (decoupling capacitors, etc.)
• Signal integrity requirements (impedance, trace length, etc.)

EXCLUDE these types of rules:
• Software configuration, API calls, register programming
• Timing specifications (setup/hold times, clock requirements)
• Operating modes and measurement settings
• Calibration procedures and algorithms
• Threshold settings and filtering parameters

CRITICAL: SELF-CONTAINED RULES ONLY - NO DATASHEET REFERENCES:
- NEVER reference tables, sections, pages, or figures (e.g., "as per Table 21", "according to Section 3.4.1", "found in Figure 5")
- NEVER say "refer to datasheet", "see specifications", "per datasheet recommendations"
- ALWAYS extract specific numerical values from tables and include them directly in the rule
- ALWAYS read tables, specifications, and values in the content and state them explicitly
- Rules must be completely self-contained and usable without the original datasheet
- If a table contains values, extract the actual values and put them in the rule text

CRITICAL: PIN NAMING REQUIREMENTS:
- ALWAYS use pin NAMES (like VDD, GND, SDA, SCL, RESET, etc.) in rule text, NEVER pin numbers
- If the datasheet mentions "pin 1, 2, 3", you must look up their corresponding names from the pin table and use those names instead
- Example: Instead of "Connect pins 1, 2, 3, and 4 to the Drain net", write "Connect VDD, VCC, AVDD, and DVDD pins to the Drain net"
- Pin numbers should ONLY be used internally for mapping purposes, never in the final rule text
- Every pin reference in a rule must be by its functional name (VDD, GND, SDA, etc.), not its physical number

EXAMPLE OF GOOD SELF-CONTAINED RULES WITH PROPER PIN NAMING:
• "Connect 32.768 kHz crystal with 18 pF load capacitors between RTC_XTI and RTC_XTO pins with maximum series resistance of 80 kΩ"
• "Supply voltage VDD must be 1.2V ±10% (1.08V to 1.32V)"
• "Place 100 nF decoupling capacitor within 5 mm of each VCC pin"
• "Connect SDA and SCL pins through 4.7 kΩ pull-up resistors to VDD for I2C communication"

EXAMPLE OF BAD RULES WITH PIN NUMBERS:
• "Connect pins 1, 2, 3, and 4 to the Drain net" ❌ (should use pin names instead)
• "Pin 7 is a separate Kelvin Source net" ❌ (should use the pin name instead)
• "Use crystal specifications as defined in Table 21" ❌
• "Follow pin termination recommendations in Section 3.4.1" ❌
• "Refer to datasheet for decoupling requirements" ❌

For each rule:
- Make it specific and actionable with exact values
- Include exact component values, voltages, resistances when specified in the content
- Extract values from any tables or specifications in the content
- Make it verifiable from hardware design files only
- Use ONLY pin names (never pin numbers) when referencing pins
- Mark "essential" as True ONLY if the rule contains keywords like "absolute" or "mandatory", or if the circuit will fail to work without it
- Mark "essential" as False for ALL recommendations, best practices, or optimization guidelines
- Ensure the rule is completely self-contained

- Group similar rules under the same category to reduce redundancy
- Use clear, specific category names without generic words like "Requirements"
- Prefer categories like: "Power Supply Voltage", "Pin Connection", "ESD Protection", 
  "Grounding and Power Plane", "Crystal Oscillator", "Decoupling Capacitors", "Signal Integrity", etc.
- Merge overlapping categories (e.g., "Power Supply" and "Power Requirements" should become "Power Supply")
- Keep essential/non-essential classification unchanged
- Keep pin assignments unchanged
- Keep rule text unchanged
